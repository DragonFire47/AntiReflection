# AntiReflection
Meant to help players who have issues with reflection in Pulsar: Lost Colony.

This mod has been revived due to VR handling reflection poorly. Noticably: VR UI (such as controllers) get inverted, and the camera for ship interiors stops behaving normally.

## Features:  
- Optionally disables reflection and reflection transition effects.  
- GUI to control reflection/transition.

## Commands:
/antireflection <reflection | transition>  
 - reflection - toggles reflection allowed/dissallowed  
 - transition - toggles reflection transition allowed/disallowed.  

## To install:  
Have PulsarModLoader installed  
go to \PULSARLostColony\Mods  
add the .dll included with this package  

## Information:  
For Game Version 1.2.01  
For PML Version 0.11.0  
Mod Version 2.0.0
